Learning journal assignments for course 201 day 8

Day 7: Today was better than yesterday marginally. I had a better grasp on what I wanted to do and how to do it but I got hung up on small stuff for long periods of time.

Day 8: If these weeks follow this overall pattern of Monday being the hardest and then gradually getting better I'll be happy. The assignment today wasn't too bad although I did try to complete it in a more difficult way than was necessary before giving up and going with the easier option.
