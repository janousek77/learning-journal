## Description
Learning journal assignments for course 201 day 5

Day 4: Touched upon more html and CSS stuff. Completed assignment that introduced us to pair programming. Coding in pairs is actually really useful when there is an error that is causing an issue. Having two sets of eyes looking for what went wrong helped us figure it out quickly. The exercise itself was relatively simple though.

Day 5: Focused mainly on CSS today and Brian was really insightful with how to style our pages. His lunch and learn session went over mainly how to get floated elements to work properly and was very helpful. We then watched a few presentations from the 401 class and I was extremely impressed with how complex their projects were especially for only having a week to complete them. The lab was a bit of a pain in my ass specifically because of the last question.
