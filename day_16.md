Learning journal assignments for course 201 day 16  

Day 16: Today we started our final project. There is so much work we need to do to have something presentable. Luckily I finished our drop down search function thing with help from my lab partners and we got a head start on our CSS which is going to be the biggest pain in that ass by far. I feel we may get it roughly put together by tomorrow and will spend most of Wednesday making everything uniform and adding some stuff that should be completed by Thursday.
