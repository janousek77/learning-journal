## Description
Learning journal assignments for course 201 day 15

Day 14: We went over CSS animations today and checked out some examples. To be honest it looks complicated and labor intensive in general and maybe outside of my current skillset so I'll stick to the more simple stuff. Also my project was picked for the project week. Dammit.

Day 15: We went over some of the things we'll learn in 301  and it looks pretty fun. This project is going to probably be intense especially considering our group is only three people and there is a lot of work we want to do.
