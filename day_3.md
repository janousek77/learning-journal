## Description
Learning journal assignments for course 201



Day 2

We learned how to if/else statements and touched on some html and css. It was mainly recap so I felt good about everything. I created the html, css, and js pages. 

Day 3

We went over some more css stuff and cover if/else statements and for, do, and while loops. Today was much more difficult in terms of lab assignment requirements. I got stuck on getting my loop to display the proper messages when they were supposed too and spent far too long figuring out what was wrong with my question 7 loop.
