Learning journal assignments for course 201 day 19

Day 19: Last day before presentation. Spent all day on CSS and still not completely happy with how some things look but its good enough. Talked a little bit about how we're going to present tomorrow. Glad this week is almost over. I'm looking forward to sleeping in for a week.
