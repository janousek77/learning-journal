## Description
Learning journal assignments for course 201 day 17

Day 17: Day 2 of the final project. I spent at least three or four hours resizing images so that they'd have a 1:1 aspect ratio Monday night. Tuesday I started working on the pages with dogs adding in pictures and descriptions. I finally got all that in by around 1 and moved on to fixing the cats pages and finished all of that by around four. I started working on styling the dog pages to look better and think I'm about done finally at almost midnight. Everything has been going extremely smoothly so far. Hopefully it continues
