Learning journal assignments for course 201 day 13

Day 12: Today we started with code review which saved what little semblance of my sanity was left from the prior day. Seriously bus mall broke me and my brain. Chart.js was easy in general. I think I had the assignment done more or less in an hour. Trying to figure out how to change certain characteristics of the charts was the hardest part and they do a terrible job of explaining how in the docs. I finished the day with the Pinterest clone that I did decently well on I think.

Day 13: Data persistence was what we did today. I thought I had grasped the concept until it came time to code which was a paired programming exercise. After struggling for an hour or so James came through and explained it and everything made sense and we got everything put together in about an hour after. Finished off the day by going to a meetup which was supposed to be a 30 or 45 minute presentation on Async functions which turned into an hour and half before I had to leave. I didn't understand large swaths of it but I was surprised by how much I did get.
