## Description
Learning journal assignment for course 301 day 7-8.

Day 7: Everything is going well this week. I feel like I'm understanding everything and getting most of my work finished.

Day 8: Today went well in the morning but I had to leave early during the afternoon lecture. I got home and watched the video on what I missed but since I'm running windows I'm not sure how to run certain things on psql. I scoured the internet for a while to make it to where I could run psql in my terminal but now I'll have to attempt to use it in the lab tomorrow and I feel a little lost.
