## Description
Learning journal assignment for course 301 day 1

Day 2: Tuesday was eventful and mostly fun. The paired programming lab went well and we finished fairly quickly without any problems really. We started learning jQuery and went into some of the ways in which its better to use than "vanilla" javascript.

Day 3: Started off good. Paired programming only gave us a few problems and overall I understand most of the things we used an why. I am a little fuzzy on why a some things work the way they do. I feel like I'll understand it all eventually at least. The linked list however I had no idea what the hell was happening there. It took James coming over and describing it in detail for me and a few others to grasp the concept but really I feel its just a surface understanding.
