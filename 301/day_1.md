## Description
Learning journal assignment for course 301 day 1

Day 1: Did pair programming with Jeff today and it went well. We figured out everything we needed to relatively quickly and had no real issues. Got home and started working on my portfolio project and I didn't get very far because I got too caught up with some CSS stuff that I messed with for way too long. Day one wasn't bad but I know the pain is coming.
