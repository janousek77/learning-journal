## Description
Learning journal assignment for course 301 day 12-13.

Day 12: Bret and I paired together and got through most of the lab. The last section was a monster that I don't think I would have gotten without significantly more time put into it. 

Day 13: Yesterday went okay pair programming went well but I had Jim as a partner so of course it was easier than what would have been normal. I pitched my project and I'm unsure if I want it to go through or not.
