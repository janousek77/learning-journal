## Description
Learning journal assignment for course 301 day 4-5

Day 4: Today was rough. I was having trouble during the paired programming. I don't feel like the I understand most of the logic. Even after the code review I feel like if I had to redo the to do's without having code to reference I wouldn't get anywhere on it.

Day 5: I still feel like I wouldn't be able to complete yesterdays lab from scratch but I understand most of the logic. It still seems abstract to be honest. I f elt a little bit better today. The paired programming went well I understand the logic on handlebars for the most part but it was way easier than yesterday.
