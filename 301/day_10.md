## Description
Learning journal assignment for course 301 day 9-10.

Day 9: Psql sucks. Looks easy on macs but it is such a pain for windows and linux. I think I've spent more time getting psql to work than I have on the labs for it.

Day 10: Lab went well except when I had to figure out how to make psql do things. Some of the 401 presentations looked great. A few of the students start jobs on Monday I can only hope I'm that lucky when I complete 401.
