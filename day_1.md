## Description
Learning journal assignments for course 201



Day 1

Today we started with a general intro to code fellows including code of conduct, how passing the course works, and how we should be prepared to feel overwhelmed. We then went over terminal usage and familiarizing ourselves with some of the functions and package installs for Atom. Finally we went went over how to use some of the dev tools on chrome and what todays assignment will be. Beyond just listing what happened I learned that I am going to have to really utilize the recordings and everything given to us to help guide us as I feel lost on the coding assignment although I have yet to actually start it.
