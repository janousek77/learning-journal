Learning journal assignments for course 201 day 17

Day 18: Day 3 of final project. We've pretty much got everything wrapped up. All the animal pages are something like 95% done. Everything looks fairly uniform across all the pages. We're finishing up a few last pages, testing and prepping for our presentation tomorrow.
