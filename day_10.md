Learning journal assignments for course 201 day

Day 8: Today was a fairly easy day going over all of the html & CSS stuff. It wasn't as easy when it came time to start using it though. It took me way too long to get things how I wanted.

Day 9: Today we went over how to use the debugger although I'm still a little hazy on how to use it after its placed into the code but I'm sure I'll iron that out with time. We had a lunch and learn where the presenter was from Microsoft and while he was informative and entertaining the only real question I wanted to know is how he felt about potentially hiring someone who has completed a code fellows course. Paired programming went fairly well although we were scrambling at the end to put things together.
